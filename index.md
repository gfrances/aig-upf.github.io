## [The FS Planner](https://github.com/aig-upf/fs)

FS is a classical planner based on the Functional STRIPS planning language,
with additional support for existential quantification, state constraints and a fairly large
library of global constraints which are useful both from the expressive and computational points of view.
and other constraint-based


## [The Lightweight Automated Planning Toolkit (LAPKT)](https://github.com/aig-upf/LAPKT-public)
LAPKT is an open-source framework written in C++ / Python to ease the creation of high-performance automated planners.
The toolkit has been succesfully used as the basis for a number of planners from
the last []International Planning Competition (2014)](https://helios.hud.ac.uk/scommv/IPC-14/), as well as
in several research projects on compilation-based and replanning approaches.

The full documentation of the toolkit can be found on the [project's main website](http://lapkt.org);
our group's [project repository](https://github.com/aig-upf/LAPKT-public) is a fork of the
[original repository](https://github.com/miquelramirez/LAPKT-public)
in former AIG member [Miquel Ram√≠rez](https://github.com/miquelramirez)'s account where development of the
toolkit geared towards supporting some of the newer group's projects is performed.


## [PROBE](http://ai.upf.edu/software/probe-classical-planner)

PROBE is a classical planner that participated in the seventh international planning competition, IPC-2011 with notable
performance.
