# AIG Software Repository Website

This is the source code for the [http://aig-upf.github.io/](http://aig-upf.github.io/) static site.
The site is published through the [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) mechanism, meaning
that on every push to this repository, the whole site is regenerated and processed on Github's servers by
a [Jekyll engine](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/).
Any subsequent request to [http://aig-upf.github.io/](http://aig-upf.github.io/) is served from
Github's HTTP servers.

## Continuous Integration

The static site is tested for a correct build process and absence of broken links, etc. through integration with
Travis:
* [https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/)
* [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/)
